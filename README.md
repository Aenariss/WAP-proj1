# WAP 2023 - Projekt 1
### Autor: VojtÄ›ch Fiala (xfiala61)

This documentation was (hopefully) generated by the JSDoc utility.
The implementation was tested using Node v18.14.2
On the right side is a "Modules" column that contains the link to the "iterate.mjs" documentation.

#### List of contents of the whole folder:
- doc.sh -- a script to generate the documentation
- (./doc) -- if the documentation was succesfully generated, then its files are found there
- iterate.mjs -- a module which exports the `iterateProperties` function and contains all the code
- jsdoc.conf -- JSDoc configuration file
- package.json -- npm stuff
- README.md -- this file, also renders as the homepage of JSDoc
- test.sh -- a script to run the tests
- tests.js -- js file that actually implements the tests
